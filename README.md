Abstract: We propose a magnetic-fluid-based approach that enables a decisive test of the long-standing Drude-plasma dispute in Casimir physics. We investigate the interaction between a polystyrene plate and a metallic sphere, both immersed in a magnetic fluid. The plasma model predicts a reversal of the force sign over a broad range of separations, in contrast to the Drude model. This qualitative effect offers a reliable and experimentally testable approach to resolving the optical-model dispute.

### Datasets
Figure 2 contains a plot of the dielectric functions on imaginary frequencies. Data set for Optical Data were provided by Prof. Paulo A. Maia Neto and Prof. Diego Dalvit. See how to cite this data inside the file. Data for polystyrene, teflon follow the paper from van Zwol and Palasantzas. Magnetic fluid is described with mixture of toluene and magnetite using a Lorentz-Lorenz mode as described in the End Matter.
