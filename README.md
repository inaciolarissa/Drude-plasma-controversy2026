Abstract: We propose a magnetic-fluid-based approach that enables a decisive test of the long-standing
Drude-plasma dispute in Casimir physics. We investigate the interaction between a polystyrene
plate and a metallic sphere, both immersed in a magnetic fluid. The plasma model predicts a
reversal of the force sign over a broad range of separations, in contrast to the Drude model. This
qualitative effect offers a reliable and experimentally testable approach to resolving the optical-model
dispute.
